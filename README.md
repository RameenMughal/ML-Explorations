# Machine Learning Explorations 

A space to analyze and experiment with Machine Learning algorithms, documenting the journey of learning in the world of AI and ML 🧭.

This repository serves as a collection of notebooks, experiments, and insights. The purpose is both to strengthen understanding and to provide a reference for students and enthusiasts exploring this field.

Currently, all studies and research are conducted using **Google Colab**, making the notebooks easy to run and share.

The long-term aim is to build a strong foundation in Machine Learning and apply this knowledge effectively in the field of Cybersecurity.

🔍 What’s inside:
- Hands-on notebooks covering ML algorithms and techniques
- Comparisons and analyses (e.g., K-Medoids vs. DBSCAN for clustering)
- Notes, reflections, and research explorations
